        Hi there! If you don't already know me, I'm Akhil. <br>
        Welcome to my little place on the internet where I publish <br>
        some of my photography, some of my projects, and really just <br>
        anything of the sort. 
        </div>
        <div id="about">
        You can find most of my current projects on my github at <br>
        akhilvanka (simple i'm aware).  Otherwise, go checkout my <br>
        LinkedIn or Twitter (where I usually don't post anything).<br>
        Anyway, thatâ€™s all I have, till next time.
